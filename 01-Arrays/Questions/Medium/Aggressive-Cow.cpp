/*
    âœ…Aggressive Cows ( Difficulty: Medium )

        You are given an array with unique elements of stalls[], which denote the position of a stall.
        You are also given an integer k which denotes the number of aggressive cows.
        Your task is to assign stalls to k cows such that the minimum distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.

    Examples :

        Input: stalls[] = [1, 2, 4, 8, 9], k = 3
        Output: 3

    Explanation: The first cow can be placed at stalls[0], 
        the second cow can be placed at stalls[2] and 
        the third cow can be placed at stalls[3]. 
        The minimum distance between cows, in this case, is 3, which also is the largest among all possible ways.
