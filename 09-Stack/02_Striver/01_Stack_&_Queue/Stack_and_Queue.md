# Stack 
 Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO principle which means last in first out.

 ### Implementation -
    
    1. Implementing stack using Array 
    2. Implementing stack using Linkedlist
    3. Implementing stack using Queue


### Operations -

    1)  .push(val)       :: used for inserting value into the stack
    2)  .pop()            :: used for removing lastValue from the stack
    3)  .top()            :: used for giving the last value of the stack
    4)  .isEmpty()       :: used for checking if the stack is empty or not
    5)  .size()           :: used for finding size of the stack



# Queue 

Queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle ( first in first out )
